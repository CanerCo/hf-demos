# T5 Fine-Tuning for Abstractive Summarization

This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune the T5 model for the task of abstractive summarization using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## 🚀 Goals
- Fine-tune the T5 model on a custom summarization dataset.
- Use the trained model to generate summaries for unseen input text.

## 🧰 Requirements
The notebook uses the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets evaluate rouge_score
```

## 📘 Contents
- **Dataset Loading**: Utilizes the `datasets` library to load and preprocess the summarization dataset.
- **Model and Tokenizer Setup**: Initializes the T5 tokenizer and model for conditional generation.
- **Training**: Fine-tunes the model using the Hugging Face Trainer API.
- **Evaluation**: Uses ROUGE metrics to evaluate the summarization performance.
- **Inference**: Demonstrates how to use the fine-tuned model to summarize new texts.

## 📝 Notes
- Make sure you have a GPU-enabled environment for training.
- The notebook is ideal for experimentation and understanding how transformer-based models like T5 can be customized for summarization tasks.
